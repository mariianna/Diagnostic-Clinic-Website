README PHP_Enabled

This folder contains index as a PHP file as it contains PHP code which successfully grabs 
data from the database created in a localhost and displays it in the website as posts. This file needs
the connection to the database to be changed according to the database settings in which it's been
used, currently it contains my localhost information.

This folder also contains the file posts.sql which was exported from my local database and contains sql
queries for creating the table and adding records.

The CSS file has been modified from how I received it in order to give the website the look of the 
received png image.
