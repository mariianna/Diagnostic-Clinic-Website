Diagnostic Clinic Methodology and Solution
When I first received the instructions for the assignment, I understood that the only file that could be modified was index.html and so that's what I did. I opened the CSS file to have as reference, but I did not change a thing, instead, I modified the style of several divs in index.html to give it the look it needed. In order to do this I mostly edited the width, float, and padding of the divs. This version is contained in the folder "Only_Index_Modified" where index.html can be viewed.
As I was modifying index.html I couldn't help but think that the way I was modifying it was not the cleanest and most efficient way to do it, so I asked if index.html was really the only file I was allowed to modify and the answer was no. Therefore, I decided to "recycle" by keeping what I had as a different version, but using it as reference in order to add the changes I had done to the CSS file in CSS format. I created several different classes which contained the width, float, and padding I had used before only this time, in the index.html file, I just needed to use that class and not change the style of the div at all. This version is contained in the folder "CSS_Index_Modified" where both the index.html and the CSS files can be viewed.
I know I was only asked to write out the table needed to include the posts in the website along with some records and their types and that I was only asked to write an example of how the PHP code would look like in order to grab data from a database and display it in the website, but I decided to actually test what I had written and implement it in my website. 
I started by writing the queries needed to create the table and insert information to it (I used the data of the already existing posts). Then, I inserted the queries into my localhost database and the table with the records was successfully created. In the index.php file I used PHP to establish a connection to my database and with an sql query, I selected all of the information in the table and stored it in a variable. I modified the html and added a while loop in PHP so that if there was another row in the table, a div with the class post would be created and information from the database would be "echoed". The website successfully displays the information taken from the database and this version is contained in the folder PHP_Enabled where both the index.php and the CSS files can be viewed along with a posts.sql file exported from my localhost showing the queries needed to create the database.
